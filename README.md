# **URL Shortener**

A web application designed to convert long, complex URLs into shorter, more manageable links. Built with **React.js** for the frontend, **Spring Boot** for the backend, **PostgreSQL** as the database, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling, this project allows users to shorten URLs, store them securely, and track click analytics. It also incorporates **Spring Security** for robust user authentication and authorization.

## **How It Works**

1. **User Registration/Login**:
   - Users can register and log in securely using **Spring Security**.
   - JWT tokens are used to manage user sessions.

2. **URL Shortening**:
   - Users input a long URL, and the system generates a unique shortened link.
   - Optionally, users can create custom aliases for personalized short URLs.

3. **Storage**:
   - Original and shortened URLs are securely stored in the **PostgreSQL** database.
   - Each URL is associated with the user who created it.

4. **Secure Access**:
   - **Spring Security** ensures that only authenticated users can shorten URLs and access their data.
